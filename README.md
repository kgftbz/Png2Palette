# Png2Palette
Makes a 256 color Palette file (.pal) with the most used colors of a png file.

Drag and Drop a PNG file into the program and it'll generate the .pal file

Usefull for importing custom textures into `Masters of Orion 2`. I'll make a guide about it soon

You should `Posterize` your image before using it on this program, you can use Paint.net for that. Paint.net allows you to choose how much posterization you're doing to the image so you can still have quality in it. Generaly it's default value of `16` should be okay.
